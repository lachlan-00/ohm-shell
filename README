OHM-shell: Python/GTK3 desktop overlay without GNOME3
-----------------------------------------------------
v0.001

Why do this?
------------
I love the gnome-shell overlay and I think the concept works well, especially on a lightweight-style desktop. I have always wanted to try using light desktops as my primary desktop and I love the overlay too much to leave it behind.

About
-----
This is a program to bring lightweight desktop environments a slick overlay style desktop launcher.

Think gnome-shell without gnome. I have been using it with openbox & gnome-settings-daemon and it's been really great so far. :)


Recent Updates
--------------
 * pre-alpha quality, basic overlay looks good at least
 * shortcuts set in the config and reload-able within the UI.
 * Open window 'dock' inside the overlay

Requires
--------
 * python 2.7
 * python-gobject (possibly others for light desktops)
 * gnome-icon-theme (for the moment)
 * gksu (shutdown and restart)
