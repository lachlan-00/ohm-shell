OHM-shell: Python/GTK3 desktop overlay without GNOME3
-----------------------------------------------------
v0.001

About
-----
This is a program to bring lightweight desktop environments a slick overlay style desktop launcher.

Think gnome-shell without gnome. I have been using it with openbox & gnome-settings-daemon and it's been really great so far. :)

Why do this?
------------
I love the gnome-shell concept works well and has become my favourite desktop design. I have always wanted to try using light desktops as my primary desktop but there is nothing as slick as gnome-shell on light desktops.

Recent Updates
--------------
 * Alpha release containing:
    - Overlay with hot corner activities rollover

Requires
--------

 * python-gobject (possibly others for light desktops)

 * gksu (shutdown and restart)
