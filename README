OhM-shell: Python/GTK3 desktop overlay without GNOME3
-----------------------------------------------------
v0.001

About
-----
This is a program to bring lightweight desktop environments a slick overlay style desktop launcher.

Think gnome-shell without gnome. I have been using it with openbox & gnome-settings-daemon and it's been really great so far. :)

Why do this?
------------
I love the gnome-shell concept; it works well and has become my favourite desktop design. I have always wanted to try using light desktops as my primary desktop but there is nothing as slick as gnome-shell on light desktops.

Recent Updates
--------------
 * Alpha release containing:
    - Overlay with hot corner activities rollover
    - Shortcuts set in the config (Options button)
      Reload changes to your favourites within the UI.
      (Will do this automatically later.)
    - Show your open windows inside the overlay

Recomendations
--------------
I have been using Openbox as my window manager using stalonetray (stand alone tray) as my system tray. I find this minimal setup very appealing and functional. as an added bonus it is configurable from obconf. :)
