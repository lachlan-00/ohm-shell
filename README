OhM-shell: Python/GTK3 desktop overlay aping gnome-shell
--------------------------------------------------------
v0.19 (Almost Alpha2)

About
-----
This is a program that is all about being a lightweight, simple and slick gnome-shell style desktop launcher.

I have tested this with every window manager i can install so far. (openbox, metacity, xfwm, compiz)

Why do this?
------------
I love the gnome-shell concept; it works well and has become my favourite desktop design. I have always wanted to try using light desktops as my primary desktop but there is nothing as slick as gnome-shell on light desktops.

Recent Updates
--------------
 * Alpha release containing:
    - Overlay with hot corner activities rollover
    - Shortcuts set in the config (Options button)
      Reload changes to your favourites within the UI.
    - Show your open windows inside the overlay

Recomendations
--------------
I have been using Openbox as my window manager using stalonetray (stand alone tray) as my system tray. I find this minimal setup very appealing and functional. as an added bonus it is configurable from obconf. :)

Recently i've been using it inside gnome-shell with the top bar hidden completely and it's just becoming usable.

Requires
--------
 * python 2.7
 * python-psutil
 * python 3.x
 * python3-psutil
 * python-gobject (possibly others for light desktops)
 * python-xdg
 * gnome-icon-theme (for the moment)
 * gnome-session
